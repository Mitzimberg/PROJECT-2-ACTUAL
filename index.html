            <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>

<!--From Highschool I've full-sent art. Bouncing between many mediums and even now I'm still
              fighting to find a passion I'm interested in. I've gone between things as simple as painting
              and as complex as sculpture & installations. A lot of my best artworks come from Highschool
              where I mostly dabbled with pencil and mixed-media and even logos/posters. Upon getting to 
              college my artwork began to branch significantly where I am now painting, sculpting, and more.

              Right now I'm an art major at LSU, but I wasn't that at first. Originally in my Freshman year I was a Graphic Design major 
              as I had found a passion for Graphic Design in Highschool. Unfortunately whenever I had vehicle problems in my Sophomore year I had to drop my Graphic Design major 
              because they could not offer Online Courses, so I inevitably had to switch. My favorite color is red.
